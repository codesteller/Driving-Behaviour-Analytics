This project is a Driver Behaviour Monitoring System that uses computer vision to analyze driver behavior in real-time. It detects various actions such as phone usage, smoking, and drowsiness, and provides feedback to improve driving safety. It also extracts drivers emotions and provides a summary of the driver's behavior.
## Features
- Real-time detection of driver actions (phone usage, smoking, drowsiness)
- Emotion detection using facial expressions
- Summary of driver behavior
- Feedback mechanism to improve driving safety
## Technologies Used
- Python (conda)
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- DeepFace
- Mediapipe
- Flask (for web interface)
